# Homework 2

Given a height map of `char[][]`, return the number of peaks. A peak is defined as a node higher than all its surroundings (8 elements in total). Each node has a height value in range 0-255.

You need to store the array in heap memory due to its potentially large geometry, despite the fact you need to manually generate a small test dataset of size at least 8*8 to show your program is working correctly. In upcoming lectures you will learn details in UNIX file IO.
